# MCM-2019-Problem-C-drug-spread-maps
We are working on MCM 2019 [Problem](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2019/problems/) C now. To visualize the spread of opioids, we made some beautiful gifs.

Because it's hard to use gifs in a pdf paper, we would like to share them with you guys. Just take what you want.

## Acknowledgement
The latitude and longitude data of 461 counties come from [SimpleMaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities), which is for free. Great Thanks!

### All drugs 
(which I mean `TotalDrugReportsCounty` in the [problem](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2019/problems/) file `MCM_NFLIS_Data.xlsx`)
